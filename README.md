# ABC_testing_tool
simple window mode program to test your knowledge with some a,b,c questions

I tested this tool with CCNA questions - thats why file that contains questions and answers is named like that.

HOW TO USE:
1.Create enviroment to run main.py - you will need to install libs from the top of main file.
2.Put your own questions inside ccna_questions.txt file (first take a look at the structure of the .txt file and consider the right formating - you can use AI to format your Q&A's) 
3.Run main.py
4.Enjoy testing your skills/knowledge

There are 2 modes:
1. Practice mode - where questions are random. There is no score in this mode but you can instantly view if your answer is good or not. In this mode you will see the good answer if you choosed wrong 
2. Exam mode - Program picks 50 questions randomly

For now - program allows to choose only one good answer - I will fix it later.
You can view your score board after an exam but every time you start again score board will be replaced with current attempt.

Yup - programm is in polish language. But Q&A's are in english... :D
